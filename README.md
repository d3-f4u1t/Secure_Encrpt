# Secure Encryptor

A simple encryption application that combines XOR encryption for message encoding and RSA encryption for key exchange.

## Features:
- Symmetric XOR encryption for the message.
- RSA key exchange to securely share the XOR key between users.(working on THIS)
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

## How to Use:
1. Enter the message you want to encrypt.
2. Choose a key for XOR encryption or use a randomly generated one.
3. The encrypted message and key will be displayed.
4. To decrypt, input the encrypted message and key, and the application will decrypt it.
